				<h1>Please read our cancel policy</h1>
				<blockquote>Our goal is to deliver books to you as conveniently as possible. So we offer delivery to our customers on all days except on Saturday. However, you can only cancel order up until 1 day of purchase. This is because the books are already on their way. For example, if you buy a book on Sunday you can only cancel the order up until Monday.  
					<p>We are extremely sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. Thank you!</p>
